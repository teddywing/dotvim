                           place "bq. " before it.
bq. Some block quoted text

                           look ma, red text!

Text Breaks

Most of the time, explicit paragraph breaks are not required - The wiki
renderer will be able to paginate your paragraphs properly.

  Notation                                Comment
(empty line) Produces a new paragraph

\\           Creates a line break. Not often needed, most of the time the wiki
             renderer will guess new lines for you appropriately.
----         Creates a horizontal ruler.

---          Produces — symbol.

--           Produces – symbol.

Links

Learning how to create links quickly is important.

               Notation                                 Comment
                                        Creates an internal hyperlink to the
                                        specified anchor or attachment.
[#anchor]                               Appending the '#' sign followed by an
[^attachment.ext]                       anchor name will lead into a specific
                                        bookmarked point of the desired page.
                                        Having the '^' followed by the name of
                                        an attachment will lead into a link to
                                        the attachment of the current issue.
                                        Creates a link to an external resource,
                                        special characters that come after the
                                        URL and are not part of it must be
                                        separated with a space.

[http://jira.atlassian.com]             The [] around external links are
[Atlassian|http://atlassian.com]        optional in the case you do not want to
                                        use any alias for the link.

                                        Examples:

                                        http://jira.atlassian.com

                                        Creates a link to an email address,
                                        complete with mail icon.
[mailto:legendaryservice@atlassian.com]
                                        Example:

                                        >>legendaryservice@atlassian.com

                                        Creates a download link to a file on
                                        your computer or on a network share
                                        that you have mapped to a drive. To
                                        access the file, you must right click
[file:///c:/temp/foo.txt]               on the link and choose "Save Target
[file:///z:/file/on/network/share.txt]  As".

                                        By default, this only works on Internet
                                        Explorer but can also be enabled in
                                        Firefox (see docs).

                                        Creates a bookmark anchor inside the
                                        page. You can then create links
                                        directly to that anchor. So the link
{anchor:anchorname}                     [My Page#here] will link to wherever in
                                        "My Page" there is an {anchor:here}
                                        macro, and the link [#there] will link
                                        to wherever in the current page there
                                        is an {anchor:there} macro.
                                        Creates a link to the user profile page
[~username]                             of a particular user, with a user icon
                                        and the user's full name.

Lists

Lists allow you to present information as a series of ordered items.

 Notation                                 Comment
            A bulleted list (must be in first column). Use more (**) for deeper
            indentations.
* some
* bullet    Example:
** indented
** bullets    • some
* points      • bullet
                  □ indented
                  □ bullets
              • points

            A list item (with -), several lines create a single list.

- different Example:
- bullet
- types       □ different
              □ bullet
              □ types

            A numbered list (must be in first column). Use more (##, ###) for
            deeper indentations.
# a
# numbered  Example:

# list       1. a
             2. numbered
             3. list

            You can even go with any kind of mixed nested lists

            Example:
# a
# numbered   1. a
#* with      2. numbered
#* nested         □ with
#* bullet         □ nested
# list            □ bullet
             3. list
* a
* bulleted  Example:
*# with
*# nested     • a
*# numbered   • bulleted
* list           1. with
                 2. nested
                 3. numbered
              • list

Images

Images can be embedded into a wiki renderable field from attached files or
remote sources.

            Notation                                 Comment
                                  Inserts an image into the page.
!http://www.host.com/image.gif!
or                                If a fully qualified URL is given the image
!attached-image.gif!              will be displayed from the remote source,
                                  otherwise an attached image file is
                                  displayed.

                                  Insert a thumbnail of the image into the page
!image.jpg|thumbnail!             (only works with images that are attached to
                                  the page).

                                  For any image, you can also specify
!image.gif|align=right, vspace=4! attributes of the image tag as a comma
                                  separated list of name=value pairs like so.

Attachments

Some attachments of a specific type can be embedded into a wiki renderable
field from attached files.

              Notation                                Comment
                                     Embeds an object in a page, taking in a
                                     comma-separated of properties.

                                     Default supported formats:

                                       • Flash (.swf)
                                       • Quicktime movies (.mov)
                                       • Windows Media (.wma, .wmv)
                                       • Real Media (.rm, .ram)
                                       • MP3 files (.mp3)

                                     Other types of files can be used, but may
                                     require the specification of the
                                     "classid", "codebase" and "pluginspage"
                                     properties in order to be recognised by
!quicktime.mov!                      web browsers.
!spaceKey:pageTitle^attachment.mov!
!quicktime.mov|width=300,height=400! Common properties are:
!media.wmv|id=media!
                                       • width - the width of the media file
                                       • height - the height of the media file
                                       • id - the ID assigned to the embedded
                                         object

                                     Due to security issues, files located on
                                     remote servers are not permitted Styling
                                     By default, each embedded object is
                                     wrapped in a "div" tag. If you wish to
                                     style the div and its contents, override
                                     the "embeddedObject" CSS class. Specifying
                                     an ID as a property also allows you to
                                     style different embedded objects
                                     differently. CSS class names in the format
                                     "embeddedObject-ID" are used.

Tables

Tables allow you to organise content in a rows and columns, with a header row
if required.

             Notation                                 Comment

                                    heading row.

||heading 1||heading 2||heading 3|| The code given here produces a table that
|col A1|col A2|col A3|              looks like:
